# Lever Application Form Filler

## Python script that automatically fills in form application inputs on websites that use Lever as their application handler/processor.

---

### WARNING: This script does have its limitations. Each Lever application can vary but for the most part this script can easily fill out the basic fields that are on most Lever applications.

---

### PURPOSE

I was getting tired of retyping the basic fields and opening up my LinkedIn, GitHub, and personal site to get the urls then copying and pasting them. On many sites that I applied to for a job, they used Lever so I decided to just keep this script ready go and use it where necessary to save me some valuable seconds.
